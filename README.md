# UnityPackageDev

A public repository where I can share the packages that I develop for the Unity 3D engine. As of right now it only contains a dev console I created to speed up development iterations at work and provide an easier way to debug multiplayer issues since we had to make builds in order to test multiplayer.

The Packages directory has a unity package of the console that can be dropped into a project, and the PackageDev directory contains a Unity project that was used to devlop and export the console package.
